# Webm Looper (and Enlarger) Userscript
Forked from [Here](https://github.com/WhatIsThisImNotGoodWithComputers/webm-looper-userscript)

A userscript which automatically enables looping on videos in your browser. It will also automatically expand the video size to fit the entire screen and mute it.
This requires you to have a userscript engine installed, one like ~~GreaseMonkey~~, Scriptish or TamperMonkey.

By default it only loops single files (urls which end in .webm or .mp4).
